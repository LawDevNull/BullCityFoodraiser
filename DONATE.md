# Bull City Foodraiser: How to Donate

**_THANK YOU_** for your interest in supporting the Bull City Foodraiser!

All donations are routed through `The T. Greg Doucette Foundation`, a 501(c)(3) public charity that coordinates fundraising and logistics for the Foodraiser. You can check [our Regulatory Info page](https://github.com/LawDevNull/BullCityFoodraiser/blob/main/REGULATORY.md) for the IRS details.

We are a community-run project that only operates once a year (or twice when funding allows), so we do not have a dedicated fundraising process and instead rely on the variety of platforms listed below.

## Project-Specific Fundraising

The 9th Annual Bull City Foodraiser has a dedicated GoFundMe page here: [stub for future URL]
